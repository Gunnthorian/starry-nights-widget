## How to install

Just drop the folder `starry-nights.widget` into your widgets folder for Übersicht

## Appearance & Options

It's super simple, in the beginning of the `starry-nights.js` file there are a few setting, and here they are and what they do:

* `background` Name of the image that is located in `starry-nights.widget` folder
* `intensity` Brightness of the stars `0` through `1`

*at the moment the starts start to appear at 7pm and disappear at 6am, peak hours are 12 & 1. There is no way to configure this, hopefully soon you will be able to.
